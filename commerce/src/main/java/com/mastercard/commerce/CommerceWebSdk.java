 * This class initiates the checkout experience using the web-based SRCi implementation.

 *
 * Transaction-specific parameters are required when initiating the checkout, such as the
 * amount and currency of the transaction.
 *
 * Existing configurations which were set when onboarding with SRC can be overridden during
 * checkout by setting these parameters as part of the {@link CheckoutRequest}. This can include
 * overriding the supported cryptogram types or whether or not CVC2 is supported.
 *
 * When checkout is completed, the {@code Activity} provided at checkout will receive a result with
 * the {@code status} and {@code transactionId} for this transaction.
